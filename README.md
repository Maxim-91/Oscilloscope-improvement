In this program, the components are placed in such a way to more closely simulate the appearance of an oscilloscope and to approximate the work in the program as quickly as possible.

On the main window there are switches, the oscilloscope graphics screen, which is slightly modified from the original:
1) when working with an oscilloscope, the student needs to adjust the clarity and placement of the sine wave, but the user of the software product does not need to do this;
2) the sine wave can be very stretched, so the student needs to adjust its height and length so that the calculation can be performed, and the program proportionally draws the sine wave on the graph;
3) the student needs to correctly calculate the scale of the sinusoid, taking into account all its transformations described above before proceeding to the calculations, and the program automatically shows the cell sizes - this significantly speeds up the work;
4) I also added to the program the ability to change the size of the graph (zoom in or out) and change the size of the cells, these possibilities will allow you to make more accurate calculations.

In this software product, you can also perform all the calculations provided by practical work, the program also performs calculations and displays the result after receiving the user's results, so the user will check the correctness of his calculations. Also, the program contains a set of formulas necessary for execution.
You can also print the result of working with the program, the printed material shows the result of the user's calculations and the program itself, which makes it easier for the teacher to check the practical work.
